Autumn is upon us in the Northern Hemisphere, and I couldn’t be more contented. This season has me sipping on rye whiskey, bumming out to folk records, and marveling at the deciduous abscission and omnipresent fog we’re graced with in the PNW. Summer was brimming with friend time, bike rides, lake swimming, and inordinate quantities of IPA; which, while awesome, has me eager to hole up and focus on projects. These dreary months will find me buried in books and sonic gadgets. I’ll let you know what I find.
