Hey everybody,

Hope 2015 has been real good to you. Between performances, recording, sound projects for film and theater, and enjoying the seasonal indulgences of swimming holes and snowshoeing, it's been teeming with moments. As the year draws its final breaths, I've had some time to breathe myself, and reflect on some of them:

In March, my friend [Nathan McLaughlin](http://www.nathanmclaughlin.info/) and I recorded an album in a Catskill cabin full of instruments. The result was long-form pieces for acoustic instruments, electronics, and location recordings of bald eagles. [Olivebridge](https://fullspectrumrecords.bandcamp.com/album/olivebridge) is available from [Editions Littlefield](http://fullspectrumrecords.com/catalog/olivebridge) on cassette.

Also in March, my friend [Andrew Weathers](andrewweathers.com) and I recorded an album in Point Reyes and Oakland, California. Blissed cosmic zones for Casio, organ, electronics, and driftwood. _Ever Steady_ is due out in 2016 via [Phinery](http://www.phinery.net/) on cassette.

In April, Nathan and I did an hour long set at the [24 Hour Drone Fest](http://basilicahudson.tumblr.com/post/119854029156/24-hour-drone-experiments-in-sound-and-music) at Basilica Hudson. Nathan situated a 24' tape loop around the space, with which we layered and processed 24 orchestra tune ups that I recorded. There's a video in the link above featuring snippets of each performance from the festival.

In September, I performed in an outdoor realization of John Cage's _Branches_ for WGXC's [Groundswell](https://wavefarm.org/archive/09a6h6) at Olana State Historic Site. There were two trio performances (Laura Kuhn, Andrew Weathers, myself; Emy Martin, Nathan McLaughlin, myself) using plant detritus found at Olana. We amplified the materials using a battery-powered mixer, FM transmitter, and radios.

Looking toward the horizon:

In late 2016 I'm planning a solo tour of the American South and Midwest. Dates and locations will be posted as they are confirmed.

A couple of recordings projects are in the pipeline, including two new [Saguache](http://www.aridradio.com/) pieces and a second full-length album with Nathan McLaughlin.

Happy New Year, and as always, thanks for listening.
