Hey everybody,

Hope 2015 has been good to you. Between playing shows, recording albums, various sound projects for film and theater, and enjoying the seasonal pleasures of swimming holes and snowshoeing, it's been pretty chockablock. As the year draws to a close, I've had some time to reflect on some of its highlights:

- My friend [Nathan McLaughlin](http://www.nathanmclaughlin.info/) and I recorded an album in a Catskill cabin full of instruments. Long-form pieces for acoustic instruments, electronics, and field recordings of bald eagles. [Olivebridge](https://fullspectrumrecords.bandcamp.com/album/olivebridge) is available from [Editions Littlefield](http://fullspectrumrecords.com/catalog/olivebridge) on cassette.
- We also did an hour long set at the [24 Hour Drone Fest](http://basilicahudson.tumblr.com/post/119854029156/24-hour-drone-experiments-in-sound-and-music) at Basilica Hudson. Nathan made a 24' tape loop around the space, and we layered and processed 24 orchestra tune ups that I've recorded. There's a video in the link above.
- I performed in an outdoor realization of John Cage's _Branches_ for WGXC's [Groundswell](https://wavefarm.org/archive/09a6h6) at Olana State Historic Site. We did two trio performances (Laura Kuhn, Andrew Weathers, myself; Emy Martin, Nathan McLaughlin, myself) using plant detritus found at Olana, and amplified the materials using a battery powered mixer, FM transmitter, and radios.
- My friend Andrew Weathers and I recorded an album in Point Reyes and Oakland. Blissed cosmic zones for organ, Casio, electronics, and driftwood. Due out on Phinery in 2016.

Late 2016 I'm planning a solo tour of the American South and Midwest. Stay tuned for dates as they are confirmed. I also have albums with [Saguache](http://www.aridradio.com/) (my duo with [Cody Yantis](http://codyyantis.com)) and Nathan McLaughlin in the works.

Happy New Year and thanks for listening.
