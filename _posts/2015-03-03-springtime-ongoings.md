Hey everybody, 

I hope 2015 has been treating you well thus far. It's been way too long since I've posted an update here.

My first Northeast winter has been abundant with snow, ice, and cold, which I've enjoyed thoroughly (I really need to get a pair of snowshoes). I've been on a performance hiatus, spending the cold months huddled up and focused on other projects. I've had the chance to build a VLF receiver, brew a big batch of coffee porter, and bake lots of oatmeal cookies. All good things, but I'm eager to get back to work on some sound projects.

A few noteworthy sound-related occurrences on the horizon: 
My friend [Nathan McLaughlin](http://www.nathanmclaughlin.info/) and I are working on a collaborative tape for Editions Littlefield, a new sub-label of [Full Spectrum Records](http://fullspectrumrecords.com/). We're headed to the Catskills in late March to go hiking, drink whiskey, and do some recording.
On April 25th, I will be participating in a 24 Hour Drone Fest at [Basilica Hudson](http://basilicahudson.com/). This is an exciting event in a gorgeous space with some great company, and I am extremely thrilled to be a part of it. I had the esteemed priviledge of mastering _Fuck Everybody, You Can Do Anything_, the forthcoming album from the Andrew Weathers Ensemble. It's a doozy, and will be available on LP and digital formats this summer.

As always, more soon and thanks for listening.
